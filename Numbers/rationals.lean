# The rationals

In this file we assume all standard facts about the integers, and then build
the rationals from scratch.

The strategy is to observe that every rationals can be written as `a / b`
for `a` and `b` integers witb `b ≠ 0`, so we define the "pre-rationals" to
be `ℤ × (ℤ - {0})`, the pairs `(a, b)` of integers. We define an equivalence
relation `≈` on `ℤ × (ℤ - {0})`, with the idea being that `(a, b) ≈ (c, d)`
if and only if `a / b = c / d`. This doesn't make sense yet, but the equivalent
equation `a * d = b * c` does. We prove that this is an equivalence relation,
and define the integers to be the quotient.

## The field structure on the rationals

We extend addition, subtraction and multiplication to the rationals, and also
define division. We then prove that the rationals are a field. The proofs are all of
the form "reduce to a question about integers, and then solve it using tactics
which prove theorems about integers".

## The ordering on the integers

In the file `RationalGameOrder.lean` we define an ordering on the rationals,
prove that it is total, and that it plays well with the ring structure
defined in this file.

## Tactic hackery

Every single proof of every single ring axiom for the rationals is:
"replace all rationals with pairs of integers, turn the question into a question
about integers, and then get the `ring` tactic to prove it"

The problem is that we need three slightly different tactics depending on whether the
axiom mentions 1, 2 or 3 variables.

Want more of this nonsense? See how the concept of order is developed
on the rational numbers in `RationalGameOrder.lean`. It's more
subtle than what we had to do here, which was only equational reasoning.
